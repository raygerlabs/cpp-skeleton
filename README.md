# Modern C++ Library

This small showcase demo is created for the sole purpose of experimenting with various modern C++ tools and technologies designed to provide a robust and versatile foundation for building software across a variety of platforms and environments. It's a comprehensive solution that takes into account the diverse needs of modern software development.

## Prerequisites

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/): An open-source cross-platform build generator
- [Conan](https://conan.io/): A portable dependency manager system
- Local C/C++ compiler toolset
  - [Microsoft Visual C/C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
  - [GNU C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  - [Clang (LLVM)](https://clang.llvm.org/)

## Purpose

The primary objective of this small project is to provide a functional C/C++ project with a rudimentary (and actually a very poor implementation) of image processing pipeline that can be easily integrated into real software projects.

The project is analysing, and examining approaches to alleviate the developer's burden of project setup and integration issues. The center idea revolves around the most common use cases in software engineering includes coding practices, testing, quality assurance, documentation, deployment, architectural testing, virtualization, and shipping the product.

I am committed to continuously improve and simplify the design to facilitate project integration. The key idiom is simplicity, usability, and most importantly, practicality.
